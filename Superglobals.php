<h1>PHP Global Variables - Superglobals</h1>
<hr>
Superglobals were introduced in PHP 4.1.0, and are built-in variables that are always available in all scopes.

PHP Global Variables - Superglobals
Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.

The PHP superglobal variables are:

 • $GLOBALS
 • $_SERVER
 • $_REQUEST
 • $_POST
 • $_GET
 • $_FILES
 • $_ENV
 • $_COOKIE
 • $_SESSION

The next chapters will explain some of the superglobals, and the rest will be explained in later chapters.
